  %p Are you fed up with the state of to-do list apps? Are you tired of super simple to-do lists that promise to quicken your workflow, only to have you screaming at their severe lack of features? Are you exhausted by to-do lists that give you way too much control, to the point where they're so fiddly that you spend all day rearranging your tasks and getting nothing done?
  %p 
    Fear not. Hypertasking is coming. Hypertasking aims to solve all these problems by providing a beautiful, usable interface for making todo lists 
    %em your
    way.
